*	how to show or hide with css in a media query

Answer: Showing/Hiding in a media query is a matter of setting up your CSS using the `display` property.  For example:

	.example-container {
		display: none;
	}
	
	@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
		display: block;	
	}
	
In the above `example-container` will not be visible in the desktop view, but after the 768px breakpoint, it will be.
